Client Documentation & Tutorials
Description
This section defines how to create clear, client-friendly documentation and tutorials that enable your SMB client to confidently use, manage, and maintain the application without your involvement. The documentation should function as a self-guided training resource, assuming the client has little to no technical background.
Your goal is to walk the client through the application in a way that feels supportive, intuitive, and easy to follow.

Explanation
Client documentation should always be written in plain language first. You may reference technical concepts when necessary, but every technical detail must be explained clearly and in context so a non-technical user understands what it means, why it matters, and how it affects them.
Assume the client is seeing the application for the first time and does not know:
How the system is built
Why certain steps exist
What actions are safe to take
What could break the system
Your documentation replaces live training. If a client can follow your guide step by step without asking for help, you have done this correctly.

Documentation Steps & Requirements 

1. Speak in Plain Language First
Before documenting any feature, establish a plain-language baseline.
Your documentation should:
Avoid jargon whenever possible
Explain what something does before explaining how it works
Clearly define any technical terms you must use
Focus on actions the client will take, not how the code works
You may highlight technical elements, but only after explaining them in simple terms. The client should never feel confused or intimidated by the language.

2. Product Overview
This section answers the question: “What is this tool and why should I use it?”
Include:
A simple explanation of what the application does
The business problem it solves
Who should use it and when
What value it provides to their day-to-day work
Use clear language and at least one screenshot of the main screen so the client can visually connect the explanation to what they will see.

3. Getting Started (First-Time Use)
This section walks the client through their first interaction with the application.
Include:
Where to access the application
How to log in
What credentials are required
What they should expect to see after logging in
Break this into small steps and include screenshots for each action. Assume the client has never logged into a system like this before.

4. Core Features Walkthrough
This is the most important part of your documentation.
For each major feature:
Explain what the feature does in plain language
Explain why it is useful to their business
Walk through exactly how to use it step by step
Include screenshots for every major action
Call out what buttons to click and what fields to fill in
Explain what happens after each action
Avoid assuming the client knows what any button, label, or term means. Be explicit.

5. Common Workflows (Real-World Scenarios)
This section shows the client how everything fits together.
Include:
Step-by-step walkthroughs of common tasks
Examples of how they might use the app in a typical day or week
What a “successful” workflow looks like from start to finish
This helps the client understand not just individual features, but how to use the application in practice.

6. Tutorial & Walkthrough Videos
Video tutorials are strongly encouraged and often more effective than written instructions alone.
Your videos should:
Show the application in real time
Walk through key features and workflows
Use slow, clear explanations
Match the written documentation
Be short and focused (5–10 minutes)
Treat these as training videos for someone new to the tool.

7. Upkeep & Maintenance
This section explains what the client needs to do to keep the application running properly.
Include:
What data or settings need regular updates
Any accounts or services they should monitor
What could cause the app to stop working
Known limitations of the system


Clearly explain that any new features, fixes, or ongoing maintenance beyond this documentation require paid hourly support.

8. Troubleshooting & FAQs
Help the client solve common issues on their own.
Include:
Common problems they may encounter
What those problems mean in plain language
Step-by-step instructions to fix them
Clear guidance on when to reach out for paid support
This section reduces frustration and support requests.
TIP: Explain to your client that if they encounter an error, they should write down the time it happened, the exact steps they took, what they were trying to do, and what they expected to happen. This information will help you reproduce the issue on your end. It is very hard to fix an error you cannot replicate.

9. Security & Access Management
Explain how to safely manage access to the application.
Include:
How to add or remove users
How passwords and credentials should be handled
Any basic security best practices they should follow
Keep this practical and easy to understand.

Documentation Format Expectations
Your documentation must:
Be clearly structured with headings
Use screenshots generously
Be easy to scan and reference
Avoid unnecessary technical detail
Be accessible via a shared link



Final Checklist
Before completing handoff, confirm:
Documentation is written for non-technical users
All features and workflows are covered
Screenshots and videos are included
Maintenance expectations are clear
Paid support boundaries are stated
Client can reasonably operate the app independently



Final Note
Clear documentation is what turns a finished build into a usable product. Your goal is to empower your client to confidently use the technology long after the project ends.
